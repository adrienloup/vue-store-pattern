# Vue Store Pattern
A sample store pattern using Vue. Here is a counter component to display notifications. The component may appear throughout the application. The problem is to coordinate the components to exchange the mutations. Vue adds setters and getters when binding states. It is necessary to distinguish states from mutations. It is a pattern derived from the Flux logic offers by Facebook.
